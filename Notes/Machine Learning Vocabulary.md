### Supervised Learning
**Supervised Learning** is when machine intelligence is tasked with predicting a category or quantity.
### Unsupervised Learning
**Unsupervised Learning** is when computer analyses unlabelled data and has no previous examples and tries to identify patterns in the data.
###Example | Sample
An example or sample is a single element in a dataset.
### Algorithm
An algorithm is a well-defined procedure that allows a computer to solve a problem.
### Model
**Model** is an **algorithm** or approach to a problem.
### Classifier
**Classifier** is a **supervised** **machine** **learning** **model** that makes a prediction about how a piece of data should be categorized.
### Classification
**Classification** is a **Supervised** **Machine Learning** **Model** that makes a prediction about how a piece of data should be categorized.
### Label
A **Label** is a category for data or a prediction from a **classification** **algorithm**.
### Regression
**Regression** is a **Supervised** **Machine Learning** **Model** that attempts to predict a quantity or a number.
### Clustering
**Clustering** is an **Unsupervised** **Machine Learning** **Model** that attempts to group similar examples together.

**Probability** is a means of expressing how likely an event will occur.
